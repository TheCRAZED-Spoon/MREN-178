Question 1:

When a key is pressed the resistance in the circuit leading to the A0 pin is increased. This makes the A0 Analog
pin have and read a lower voltage value. The general reading will depend on which button is pressed with certain ranges pertaining 
to certain button presses. After the pin reads the value, it is captured in memory by the 'button_read' variable. To be stored in
memory, the analog (voltage) value must be converted into a computer-storable value. In this case that would be an int.
(the return type of the analogRead function)


Question 2:

The Arduino analogRead function returns an int. On an Arduino an int is stored as 2 bytes of data [1]. As such we store
the read value as an int. This yields max and min values of -32,768 to 32,767. If you attempt to store something larger
or smaller than those bounds, you will run into an integer overflow or underflow respectively. This will not crash the 
program, however will result in essentially garbage values. (when overflowing, the number will wrap around to -32,768)


Question 3:

On an Arduino there are 3 types of memory [2]. There is flash, RAM and eeprom. The flash is used to store sketches
and is considered non volatile. This means that it does not require power to store values. Thus anything stored
in the flash memory (our programs) will persist after losing power. For our actual number that changes during operation, 
it is stored in the RAM [2] which is a volatile type of memory, meaning that it is erased on power loss. There is also
eeprom which is also non-volatile, however it is not used in our sketch. 

When the reset button is pressed, it has the same effect as disconnecting the board from power [3]. This causes all
non-volatile memory to be reset, and when the board does regain power, the flash memory is re-loaded, thus restoring
our program to the initial state defined in the void setup() function.
